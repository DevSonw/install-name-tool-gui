An old project I moved from code.google.com/p/install-name-tool-gui

Gui front-end for install_name_tool

Download prebuilt binary from: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B6g549Lw3gdJc21YbkJtbVhTNUE

A gui front-end for install_name_tool (and otool -L). Making changes in the GUI calls install_name_tool (-change or -id) to apply changes, and otool -L to update the data display.

Shows the library ID and the dependant libraries in a editable table. Table edits are applied immediately, so be careful.

For a detailed dependancy listing look at this https://code.google.com/p/macdependency
